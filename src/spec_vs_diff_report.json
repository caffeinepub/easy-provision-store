  "summary": "The diff adds a basic catalog/cart/checkout UI and a Motoko backend, but several core acceptance criteria are not met: backend product/order models don’t match the spec (no inStock, no line-item orders, no timestamp), checkout submits only the first cart item, error handling/confirmation are implemented via sessionStorage rather than backend order details, and backend persistence/seed data for products/orders is missing. Some unrequested features were also added (Internet Identity plumbing, admin-like addProduct, category/search backend endpoints, shipping address requirement).",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Backend query method returns full product list including id, name, optional description, price, optional unit/size, category, and inStock/available.",
      "reason": "Backend Product type lacks unit/size and inStock/available boolean (uses stock: Nat instead), and description is not optional.",

        "backend/main.mo"

      "id": "REQ-3",
      "requirement": "Backend exposes an update method to create an order containing line items (productId, name snapshot, unit price snapshot, quantity), total amount, customer details (min: customer name), and created timestamp, returning a unique orderId.",
      "reason": "Backend order model is a single-product order (productId/quantity), lacks line items array, lacks created timestamp, and lacks name/unit price snapshots; frontend also submits only the first cart item and stores confirmation details in sessionStorage rather than using backend-returned order details/timestamp.",
